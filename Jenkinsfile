        stage('Pull Git Content') {
            steps {
                // Delete the existing folder (if present)
                sh 'rm -rf my-git-folder'
                
                // Clone the repository

Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository.

Step 5: Push to the Develop Branch

Make changes to your code.
Push the changes to the develop branch of your Git repository.
Step 6: Monitor the Pipeline

Go back to your Jenkins dashboard.
Open your pipeline job.
You should see the pipeline being triggered and executed.
Click on the pipeline run to see the details and logs.
The Jenkins pipeline will trigger whenever there's a push to the develop branch. It will clone the repository content to a folder named "my-git-folder" in the Jenkins workspace.

Remember to customize the pipeline and Jenkinsfile to match your specific requirements and repository structure.
